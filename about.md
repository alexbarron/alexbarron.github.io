Hey, I'm Alex Barron. I'm a software business guy transitioning to the technical side of the industry. I live in LA but I'm from the SF Bay Area originally and plan to move back early 2016. I spent 3 years studying and working in Asia(China & Japan) until returning to the US in 2012. Big fan of painfully spicy food, pugs, and travel.
